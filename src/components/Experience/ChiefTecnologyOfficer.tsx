          <p>
            Proud to be promoted as CTO in the company I started for. I was
            responsible to design the architecture of the different bespoke
            projects, and tech-leading most of them, also coding the most
            challenged pieces, or the ones that needed first some R&D. Most of
            the projects here were custom solutions based on MOSS 2007 and
            SharePoint 2010, but also custom Windows services that integrated
            data between SharePoint and different systems. Technically was a lot
            of .NET code, WebAPIs, SQL Server, but also started coding with
            jQuery and JavaScript, and first deep dive in the Azure world,
            coding some web roles that were called from SharePoint, offering
            automatic translations using third party APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I managed a technical team with about 15 people. I also did some
            consultant stuff and pre-sales support. I reported directly to the
            executive board.
