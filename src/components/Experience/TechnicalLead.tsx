            I kept developing custom solutions. They were my first years working
            with the .net platform, mainly doing web apps with asp.net webforms,
            but also custom Windows services. I started working with SharePoint
            2003, coding webparts. I also got experienced with the good old
            WebServices (SOAP) and later with WCF.
