            During these years, I was promoted to Software Architect, but still
            coding a lot. I keep working in bespoke projects, doing a lot of
            .NET code with SQL Server. I started learning and working with
            Architectural patterns like DDD or CQRS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I kept tech-leading most of the projects, evangelizing our dev team,
            and setting patterns and best practices.
