            After doing my apprentice program in Encamina, I was hired by them.
            There were a couple of very intensive years. I started coding web
            apps using classic ASP and some javascript (doing the only thing we
            could do with JS: validating forms and swapping images on hover),
            calling COM components I coded using Visual Basic 6. I did a lot of
            SQL Server and MySQL. I had the opportunity to work in a project
            building a B2B site, based on MS Commerce Server product, so I
            learnt a lot of ASP 3.0, SQL, and started with some kind of Workflow
            system the product had.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also worked with non MS technologies, which helped me a lot to
            grow in different technologies. I coded a bunch of PHP code, and
            some Java (which helped me to learn things like Design patterns and
            SOLID principles).
