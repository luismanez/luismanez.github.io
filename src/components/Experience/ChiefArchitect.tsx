            Currently working as a Chief architect and technical authority,
            building a product we called Atlas. Atlas is built in top of Office
            365, and leverage by Azure, creating a real Digital Workplace,
            customizing the experience to each specific user. In the last 2
            years I have been working massively with MS Graph API, creating
            custom APIs and solutions that expand Graph functionality. During my
            first years in the company, I worked with large organization
            designing bespoke solutions for Microsoft 365 and SharePoint, and
            coding the most challenged parts of these solutions, specially when
            working with Graph API or securing them with Azure Active Directory.
            During all these years I have been exposed to a great range of MS
            technologies, like MS Graph, Azure AD, Azure Functions, SharePoint
            Framework (SPFx), .NET Core, WebAPI, SharePoint API, CSOM, Azure
            Search, Azure SQL, Entity Framework, Redis Cache, Cognitive
            Services, Cosmos DB. Also gained some experience in the front-end
            side, especially with Typescript, ReactJS and Redux.
          </p>
          <p>
            Worth to mention that during this period, I have been awarded as
            Microsoft MVP in Microsfot 365 Development, so you can find me
            easily speaking at events and contributing in the community,
            especially in the OfficeDev PnP program, where I have done different
            demos showing how to work with Graph API from SPFx. In the last 2
            years, I have been invited to the M365 DevKitchen event.

            Besides all the cool tech things, another duties include helping our
            developers to code better, establish good practices, code-reviews,
            and lead the recently created R&D Department, where my task is to
            keep me updated with cutting-edge technologies, doing POCs to
            evaluate if those technologies are gonna help us to make a better
            product.
